# Iris_Flower_Classification
# Overview :
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on the measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
# Project Overview:
üìä Dataset:
I used the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each iris species.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries:
Python
pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn

# Project Steps:
# Data Exploration:
Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn to understand its structure.
Explored the features and gained insights into the characteristics of each iris species.

# Data Preprocessing:
Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Standardized the features to ensure a consistent scale across all measurements.

# Model Training:
Utilized a Random Forest Classifier for its ability to handle multiple features and classification tasks effectively.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier, chosen for its ability to handle multiple features and achieve high accuracy in classification tasks.

# Results :
The trained model demonstrates robust performance in classifying iris species. Evaluation metrics, including a confusion matrix and classification report, are available in the notebook.

# Next Steps :
Explore hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Consider deploying the model for real-time predictions in a production environment.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's performance using a confusion matrix and classification report.
Achieved excellent classification results, showcasing the model's ability to generalize well.
